In this next Pro Project, we're going to practice element positioning in CSS so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? Applying the display and position properties on a certain element is something you'll be doing plenty of with CSS, so exploring and practicing it now will help you a lot. What's next? Concrete jungle, design firm, more CSS. You got this! -->
