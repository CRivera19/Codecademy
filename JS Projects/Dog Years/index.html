<!-- It's time to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals. 
In this next Pro Project, we're going to practice variables 
and strings in JavaScript so you can hone your skills and feel 
confident taking them to the real world. Why? These concepts 
will help you use your data to output information to your
users. What's next? Dog ages, interpolation, more JavaScript. 
You got this! -->
